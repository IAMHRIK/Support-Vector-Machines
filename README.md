# SVM on Breast Cancer Dataset

This project trains Support Vector Machines (SVM) with both linear and RBF kernels on the Breast Cancer dataset (from sklearn).

## Key steps:
- Data standardization
- SVM training (linear + RBF)
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Cross-validation
- PCA for 2D visualization
- Decision boundary plotting

## Requirements
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy

- ## Thats all
